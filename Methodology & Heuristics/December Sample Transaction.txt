December Sample Transaction and Methadology
----------------------------------------------
Please see March Sample Transaction for previous iterations of data sampling.
This document iterates over the March sample, with a few minor changes.

Strategies to Establishing a Methadology
----------------------------------------------
Yuval and I have decided thyat three transactions would suffice for preliminary investigation.
We further agreed that if our first sample was March 11, a logical addition would be 
a December 11 Sample and a June 11 sample.

I have decided to use this block explorer due to the formatting of Wasabi Coinjoins.
https://btc.com/bc1qs604c7jv6amk4cxqlnvuxv26hv3e48cds4m0ew

I know have a comprehensive list of all CoinJoins as all CoinJoins pay fees to the coordinator
address that I ued to query. Note that not all transactions in this query are CoinJoins, but
by the nature of Wasabi CoinJoins - all CoinJoins will exist somewhere in the query.

I decided to use the first CoinJoin that occured on December 11, 2018
https://btc.com/bc1qs604c7jv6amk4cxqlnvuxv26hv3e48cds4m0ew?page=86

I have found a CoinJoin I am ready to investigate (wtxid):
7417d0c5eecfc30e1e0812f39d5a3962c3e58d6907a03af8508e21d3d9eb8987

I can now use another block explroer with preferred feature for transaction-spefic queries:
https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/7417d0c5eecfc30e1e0812f39d5a3962c3e58d6907a03af8508e21d3d9eb8987

I noticed that this CoinJoin has: 
  - 41 participants that received (0.09988131 BTC) in mixed outputs, from index (0 - 40)
  - 0 Participants that received higher denomination outputs
  - 23 participants that received change from the mix, from index (41-63)
  - (0.00383280	BTC) Was received by the coordinator addres at index (64)

Of the 41 mixed outputs, only 3 remained unspent at the time of writing.

Now I can begin to select mixed outputs and observe how they are being spent. I will begin at index 0 and work
my way down the list. After having gone through the first few spent outputs, I realize that there are common
categories of behaviour. In an attempt to be more systematic with the process, I have decided to relfect
these common categories with a table.

In my first attempt, I decided to use a .txt file to record results. In this iteration, I would like to
use a csv file for collecting results, and keep the details of the categories here.

Index	:	The index of the output in the CoinJoin transaction (0 -> 40 for the 0.1 BTC mixed coins)
Spent?	:	Boolean value, True if the output is currently spent
	Remixed?:	If it was Spent by a Wasabi CoinJoin, this counts as a remix (Boolean)
		Rmx Wtxid:	The Transaction ID of the remix CoinJoin
		Rmx Index:	The index in the inputs of the remix
		Date	:	The date of the remix
		MergeMix?:	Boolean - Was the remix done with more than a single coin? 
		n-merged:	How many coins were consolidated? I believe the maximum is 2, but there could be more.
		Type merged:Where the merged coins all previously mixed, or was there change added to the mix?
	Add-RU?	:	Boolean value, if the address receiving mixed coins was reused
	N-RU	:	Number of times used (1 is minimum, 2 is normal, >=2 is re-used)
Merged?	: Boolean value that represents if other Wasabi Mixed Coins were spent in the same transaction (does not include dust attack spent)
	N-Merged: The number of mixed coins merged, where the result is a tuple represnting different denominations e.g. (2,1,1) = Two 0.1 BTC + one 0.2 BTC plus one 0.4 BTC merged
	Note that if N-Merge = 6, this means that the total number of coins spent in that transaction was 6
	Note if N-merge is a single number (not a tuple) then the default is 0.1 BTC denominations
	The minimum number of N-Merge is 1, but there can still be dust attacks merged.
	Oldest: The date of the oldest merged coin
	Newest: The date of the newest merged coin
	Dust?: Boolean value that represents if any dust was spent. Dust in this case is > 0.00010000 BTC AND comes from a dust attack transaction
	A Dust attack transaction is one where many hundreds of addresses are given very small amounts of Bitcoin (Dust Amounts)
	N-Dust: The number of dust UTXOs spent in the same transaction
Change?: A Boolean value that represents whether or not change from a W-CoinJoin was spent at the same time as a mixed output.
	N-Change: Number of Chage outputs spent in tandem with the mixed coin
	N-Out: The number of recipient addresses given the coins
	ADDR-T: Address Type of the Received Coins, Relevant values include: P2PKH, P2PK, P2SH, P2WSH, MIXED,
	In the case of MIXED, if coins were sent to multiple addresses (I think it is always maximum 2) then in that case,
	There is one address and another address are of different types. Typically, Wasabi allows for only Bech32 change,
	So this likely means that if (MIXED) is present, then the user spent the coin and has change, and the change is obvious.
	ReUSe: The address that received the coins - has it been used more than 2 times (the minimum number, in 1 in and 1 out)
	This is a Boolean value and can only happen if the same address has received more than 1 times.
	N-ReUse: The number of transactions in total, affecting this address. Only important if Re-Use is TRUE
