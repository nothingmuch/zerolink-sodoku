Heurist 1 Methadology - Unmixed Change Merging
----------------------------------------------
Defintion:
  With every Waasabi CoinJoin, we are able to parse the CoinJoin into 4 parties:
  (1) Input clusters (an input or input(s) that have participated in the Coinjoin
  (2) Mixed blinded outputs (by denomination and number of co-participants)
  (3) Change outputs (are, to my knowledge, always linked to specific input clusters)
  (4) The Coordinator Fee Address (bc1qs604c7jv6amk4cxqlnvuxv26hv3e48cds4m0ew)
  
Heursitic #1 is concerned with identifying users that have engaged in a transaction
with the following parameters:
  (a) the transaction contains at least one input from the Mixed Blinded Output Set (#2 above)
  (b) the transaction contains at least one input from the change outputs set (#3 above)
  
Note that by this definition, we are not considering more edge cases where the coins from 
set #2 and set #3 merge, but in later parts of the transaction graph. For now, we consider only
the simplest case.

Strategies to Establishing a Methadology
----------------------------------------------
I begin by taking a medium sized Wasabi transaction that is several weeks old. I am choosing 
an older transaction because I would like to pick a CoinJoin that has nearly all mixed outputs
spent. I further want to take a medium size CoinJoin as it will be faster to process by hand.

I have decided to use this block explorer due to the formatting of Wasabi Coinjoins.

I know have a comprehensive list of all CoinJoins as all CoinJoins pay fees to the coordinator
address that I ued to query. Note that not all transactions in this query are CoinJoins, but
by the nature of Wasabi CoinJoins - all CoinJoins will exist somewhere in the query.

I decided to scroll to page 50 to get a CoinJoin from March 11, 2019
https://btc.com/bc1qs604c7jv6amk4cxqlnvuxv26hv3e48cds4m0ew?page=50

I have found a CoinJoin I am ready to investigate (wtxid):
b8447f6a0dfa4d0e3c05f66a8f8f9b77cfde9d9e1a862d912ec24a8dfd2c2547

I can now use another block explroer with preferred feature for transaction-spefic queries:
https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/b8447f6a0dfa4d0e3c05f66a8f8f9b77cfde9d9e1a862d912ec24a8dfd2c2547

I noticed that this CoinJoin has: 
  - 54 participants that received (0.09938927 BTC) in mixed outputs, from index (0 - 53)
  - 10 Participants that received (0.19876128 BTC) in mixed outputs, from index (54 - 63)
  - 5 participants that received (0.39752256 BTC) in mixed outputs, from index (64 - 68)
  - 42 participants that received change from the mix, from index (69 - 110)
  - (0.00941352	BTC) Was received by the coordinator addres at index (111)
  
Of the 69 mixed outputs, only 2 remained unspent at the time of writing.

Now I can begin to select mixed outputs and observe how they are being spent. I will begin at index 0 and work
my way down the list.
